REM  AutoOffline.dll build script (MSVC)
REM
REM  Deployment: the resulting DLL is renamed to RtWorkQ.dll and placed in the
REM  game folder. The game loads it by itself - see README.md.
REM
REM  The build is reproducible: the same source on the same toolchain gives the
REM  same bytes. See the Toolchain section of README.md.

echo The build is reproducible: same source on the same toolchain gives the

echo To use it: rename it to RtWorkQ.dll and put it in the game folder -
echo or simply run helper-scripts\1-disable-eaac.bat, which does that for you.

REM  path contains parentheses, as "Program Files (x86)" does.

echo     NOTE: the game merely RUNNING does NOT lock the file. Only injection does.
